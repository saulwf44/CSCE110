# CSCE110
Final Project for CSCE 110 (Python Programming)
# This is a data intrepreting software used to create charts and output data of a selected student or class. 
# First you must allow the program to read the data by typing 1, then inputing the name of the .csv file "grades.csv"
# Then by typing the student's UIN (Universal Identifaction Number) found in column A, you can select a student you will want to generate 
# a report or a set of charts for (options 2 and 3).
# You can also generate data for the entire class (options 4 and 5).
